/// A [StreamTransformer] that provides an alternative but equivalent interface to [StreamController]s.
/// Instances are intended to be passed to [Stream.transform].
/// 
/// Although [StreamController]s are very powerful tools for fine-grain control over streams,
/// they are an extremely verbose interface, and simple tweaks to a stream's lifecycle
/// can require a large amount of boilerplate. This class abstracts as much of that boilerplate
/// as possible, leaving you with only one implementation requirement: forwarding stream data events.
/// 
/// Like [StreamTransformer]s in general, this class is conceptually just a function transforming a
/// "source stream" into a "destination stream". This class is meant to be extended and contains
/// various "hooks" that can be overridden, representing pieces of this "transformation function".
/// These overridable hook methods are:
/// - [onBindDestController]
/// - [destOnListen]
/// - [destOnCancel]
/// - [destOnPause]
/// - [destOnResume]
/// - [sourceOnData] (required)
/// - [sourceOnError]
/// - [sourceOnDone]
/// 
/// This provides everything you'll need to implement a [StreamController]-based algorithm,
/// but without most of the headache. Override any hooks you need or want to. Most are provided
/// with a `context` object providing references to the source stream, the current subscription,
/// and the destination stream's controller. If you don't override anything, this transformer
/// will forward all cancel/pause/etc signals and act just like the given source stream,
/// including single-subscription stream behaviors. If you *do* override a hook but
/// still want default behavior, use `super` to call into the base method implementation.
/// If you want to *completely replace* a hook's behavior, simply *don't* call `super`.
/// However, exercise caution when replacing the `destOn...()` hooks, as you will almost certainly
/// want to utilize their default behavior, even though it is not a requirement to.
/// Make *sure* you know what you're doing if you decide not to use `super.destOn...()`.
